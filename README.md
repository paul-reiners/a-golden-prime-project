A Golden Prime Project
======================

Overview
--------
[Goldbach's conjecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach's_conjecture) states that every even integer > 2 is the sum of two primes.  It has not been proved, but has been confirmed by computer for n up to 4 Ã— 10^18.


This project contains computational experiments regarding Goldbach's conjecture.


Finding Pairs of Primes
-----------------------
AGPP.getPrimePairs returns all prime pairs that sum to n for input argument n.  For n up to about 57,000, it returns all prime pairs in less than 30 seconds.
