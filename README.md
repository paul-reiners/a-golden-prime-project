A Golden Prime Project
======================

Goldbach's Conjecture
---------------------
[Goldbach's conjecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach's_conjecture) states that every even integer n greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.  It has not been proved, but has been confirmed by computer for n up to 4 Ã— 10^18.


This project contains computational experiments regarding Goldbach's conjecture.

Prime Generation
----------------
Rather than write the prime generation code in Haskell myself, I decided to concentrate on code related to Goldbach's conjecture in this project.  I've used the Sieve of Erastothenes implementation in Haskell given in [*The Haskell Road to Logic, Maths and Programming*](http://homepages.cwi.nl/~jve/HR/#Home) by Kees Doets and Jan van Eijck.

I've written prime generation code in C in my [a-prime-project](https://github.com/paul-reiners/a-prime-project/blob/master/prime.c).


Finding Pairs of Primes
-----------------------
AGPP.getPrimePairs returns all prime pairs that sum to n for input argument n.  For n up to about 57,000, it returns all prime pairs in less than 30 seconds.
